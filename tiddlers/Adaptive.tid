An ''adaptive'' [[Optimization Algorithm]] chooses points to sample based on previously-seen values of the [[Objective]] function, and a ''non-adaptive'' algorithm chooses the points to sample in advance.

[[Golden Section Search]] is an example of an adaptive algorithm, and [[Grid Search]] a non-adaptive one.
