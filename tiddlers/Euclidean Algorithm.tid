title: Euclidean Algorithm
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Given integers $$a, b > 0$$ we apply division with remainder repeatedly as follows:

```python
def euclidean_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Determines the GCD of ``a`` and ``b`` with the Euclidean Algorithm.
    """
    while a != 0:
        a, b = b % a, a
    return b
```
