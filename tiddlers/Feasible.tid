A [[Solution]] to an [[Optimization]] problem is ''[[Feasible]]'' if it satisfies all of the problem's [[Constraint]]s.

That is, a [[Vector]] $$\vec x \in S$$ where $$S$$ is the [[Constraint]] set is a ''feasible solution'' to that problem.

Feasible solutions may additionally be [[Suboptimal]] or [[Optimal]].
