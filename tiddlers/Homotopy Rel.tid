A [[Homotopy]] $$f_t : X \to Y$$ whose [[Restriction]] to a [[Subspace]] $$A \subset X$$ is independent of $$t$$ is called a ''homotopy relative to $$A$$'' or a ''homotopy rel $$A$$''.

A [[Deformation Retraction|Deformation Retract]] of $$X$$ onto $$A$$ is a homotopy rel $$A$$ from the [[Identity Map]] of $$X$$ to a [[Retraction|Retract]] of $$X$$ onto $$A$$.
