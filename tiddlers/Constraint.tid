Additional conditions an [[Optimization Variable]] must satisfy to be [[Feasible]].

We can view the constraints as a set $$S \subseteq \R^n$$ of [[Solution]]s, but constraints are often expressed as [[inequalities|Inequality]] or [[equalitites|Equation]] of the [[Optimization Variable]]s, e.g. for the [[Objective]] $$x^2 + 2y - 2$$, a ''constraint'' might be $$|x| \ge 1$$, $$y < 3$$, or $$\sin |x| = 0$$.
