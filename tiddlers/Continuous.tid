A {{fn}} between {{topsps}} is ''continuous'' if for every [[Open Set]] $$V \subseteq B$$, $$f^{-1}(V)$$ is open in $$A$$.

Equivalently, $$f$$ is continuous if and only if either of the following conditions holds:

# $$f$$ is [[continuous at|Continuous at a Point]] all $$a \in A$$.
# For every [[Closed Set]] $$V \subseteq B$$, $$f^{-1}(V)$$ is closed in $$A$$.
