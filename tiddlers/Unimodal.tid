An [[Objective]] function $$f : [a, b] \to \R$$ is ''unimodal'' if there exists a point $$x^* \in [a,b]$$ such that $$f$$ is [[Monotone Decreasing]] on $$[a, x^*]$$ and [[Monotone Increasing]] on $$[x^*, b]$$.

For [[Continuous]] functions, unimodality is equivalent to having a unique relative minimum.
