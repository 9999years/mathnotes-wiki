The ''genus'' of an [[Orientable|Orientability]] is an integer representing number of "holes" an object has; the [[Sphere]] and [[Disc]] both have genus zero, and a [[Torus]] has genus one.

An orientable surface $$M_g$$ of genus $$g$$ can be constructed from a polygon with $$4g$$ sides by identifying pairs of edges, a shown below for the cases $$g = 1,2,3$$. The $$4g$$ edges of the polygon become a union of $$2g$$ circles in the surface, all intersecting at a single point.
